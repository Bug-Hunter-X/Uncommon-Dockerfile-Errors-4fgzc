This repository contains an example of an uncommon but impactful error in a Dockerfile. The original Dockerfile uses the `ubuntu:latest` image, which lacks reproducibility and might have unexpected changes in the future.  It also fails to cleanup after installation, leading to bloated images.  The solution demonstrates a more robust and efficient Dockerfile, using a specific ubuntu version, adding cleanup and showing best practices.
